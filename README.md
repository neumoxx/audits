# Bio
Bug bounty hunter and security researcher, specialized in Clarity, Solidity, and Rust, with some experience in Go. I’ve worked on everything from the NEAR node implementation, to most (if not all) lending, borrowing, and staking protocols in Stacks, to the smart contracts of the most popular DeFi protocols on Ethereum. I’ve also analyzed CosmosSDK-based codebases such as Polygon’s and dYdX.
